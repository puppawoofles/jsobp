                    <h2>V0.0.1</h2>
                    <p>Initial demo!  What works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unit cards can be played.</li>
                        <li>Initial Autobattling Structure</li>
                        <li>Units have scripts that allow them to act during autobattling.</li>
                        <li>Autobattling: <ul>
                            <li>Volley Structure: 8 volleys that units can act on.</li>
                            <li>Units act in block order.</li>
                            <li>Team order within a volley is configurable (e.g. do enemies or allies go first)</li>
                            <li>Units can combo when certain conditions are met.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Unit Skills: Allow units to do things during autobattling. <ul>
                            <li>"Strike" skill: Player units do 8 damage, Rats do 2.</li>
                            <li>"Step" skill: Unit moves toward destination 1 square orthogonally.  If it can't, it gains 1 Agility instead (increases number of squares moved next time this is used).</li>
                            <li>"Retreat" skill: Unit removes 1 stack of Retreat status.  Once it's 0, the unit returns to your discard pile.</li>
                        </ul></li>					
                        <li>"Order" cards: Instructs a unit with a short-term goal.  Override each other.<ul>
                            <li>"Reposition": Instruct a unit to move to a given destination.  Temporarily overrides all skills to be "Step"</li>
                            <li>"Retreat": Instruct a unit to return to your discard pile.  Temporarily overrides all skills to be "Retreat", grants 3 stacks of the "Retreat" status.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Encounters:<ul>
                            <li>"The Rats": 8 rats distributed between 2 blocks randomly.  Rats only use "Strike" for 2 damage each once per round.</li>
                        </ul></li>

                            <li>"Push" skill: Pushes a unit back in the direction the acting unit is facing.  If there is another unit in the way, they collide with one another dealing damage.  The distance a unit is pushed is based on the attack strength of the pushing unit against the weight of the defending unit.</li>
                            <li>"Defend" skill: Unit gains Defense, which is used to block damage from attacks and collisions.  This defense is lost at the end of a round.</li>
                            <li>"Bleed" skill: Target enemy gains the Bleed status based on 75% of the unit's attack damage.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Player Units:<ul>
                            <li>Units with üå™Ô∏è birth month have "Strike" and "Push" by default.</li>
                            <li>Units with üî• birth month have "Strike" and "Bleed" by default.</li>
                            <li>Units with ‚õ∞Ô∏è birth month have "Strike" and "Defend" by default.</li>
                            <li>Units with üíß birth month still only have "Strike".  Sorry, water benders!</li>

                            <li>"Golem": New enemy!</li>
                        </ul></li>

                            <li>"The Golems": Maybe this is like an Elite combat?  Better kill them before they catch up to you!</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Gameplay:<ul>
                            <li>Basic Persistence: Your deck is saved after each combat, and is fed into the start of the next one.  Can't heal units yet though!</li>
                            <li>Gold: You get 50 gold when you win a combat now.  Neat!  You also start with 50 gold.  Not that it's particularly useful yet...</li>
                            <li>Card Mechanics: Updated to more closely resemble "normal" games:<ul>
                                <li>You start each combat with 5 cards, and draw 1 card at the start of each round.  (You will start each combat with 6 cards effectively)</li>
                                <li>You can no longer play cards to the discard pile to cycle your deck.  Instead, you can click on your deck icon to draw additional cards.  This costs an increasing amount of gold.</li>
                                <li>The cost of drawing cards caps at 10 gold and increases by 1 for each additional draw.</li>
                                <li>Your max hand size is 10 cards.  If you draw more, your leftmost card is discarded.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>Skills have a new activation zone: Close Quarters.  This is indicated by the arrow portion of the activation icon, and applies to enemy units in the same cell block as the unit.  Units in foreign cell blocks only have Close Quarters abilities available.</li>
                            <li>"Strike": Attack. Front row and close quarters only.  Blocked entirely by barricades.</li>
                            <li>"Throw": Attack. Middle row.  Unblocked by obstacles in the same block.</li>
                            <li>"Shoot": Attack.  Back row.  If this unit has obstacles all up in its business, then it will hit that for half damage.  Otherwise, this will hit the intended target.</li>
                            <li>"Defend": Active everywhere but the middle cell.</li>
                            <li>"Protect": Active everywhere but the corner cells.  If an adjacent ally has low HP, gives them extra block.  Otherwise, applied to self.</li>

                            <li>Rewrote all pathing / movement logic to factor in the ability to move between blocks.  There's still wonkiness here.</li>
